R codes are included for two spatial phylogeographic analyses using SNP data: Peter & Slatkin's 2013 (Evolution) directionality index, based on code by Qixin He for He, Prado & Knowles 2017 (Molecular Ecology), and a Procrustes test for genetic and geographic association (Wang et al 2012, PLoS Genetics), adapted from code by Luciana Resende-Moreira for Resende-Moreira et al 2019 (Journal of Biogeography). A separate R script for each analysis is provided for two species, Agyrtodes labralis and Brachynopus scutellaris. The Procrustes code is for a global analysis (species' full geographical range), while the Directionality Index code performs separate analyses for individual geographic regions (i.e., individual genomic clusters identified via a STRUCTURE analysis). Input files for each analysis are available at DataDryad.
